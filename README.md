## Why?

Because it's fun and I am a big believer in creating software for fun. Generally I'd like to consider myself a curious person that wants to do cool stuff in their spare time - not just web development

## What did you use?

OpenVC and dlib for fecial recognition and detection. I downloaded models and shape predictor from [here](https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models)
Numpy for some processing
ChatGPT to stitch this all together (yeah I am not that smart to do it in a couple of hours alone)
My laptop's webcam but I also tried vdo.ninja and OBS studio and it works suprisingly well even on my shitty phone
70 images of my fiance

## Results

Well it's pretty good. It's suprisingly efficient in recognizing Rain, it had some minor hickups but let's be realistic - 70 images is not a large dataset

## CPU and RAM usage

Well by computer isn't the best but I have 32GBs of ram and it overheats almost instantly - python isnt the most efficient language so that's understandable

## Can I use it?

yeah sure I don't really care - anybody could build that with a little bit of time especially since you don't need to know anything except some python

Cheers! :wave:
